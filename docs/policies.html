  </ul>

  <h2>8. Enforcement (How We Act)</h2>
  <p>
    Aligno may use automated systems and human review to enforce these policies. Actions may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removing content (posts, comments, pinned boards, event listings) or limiting distribution.</li>
    <li>Issuing warnings or placing accounts into restricted status.</li>
    <li>Suspending or banning accounts, including for repeated or severe violations.</li>
    <li>Preserving evidence for investigations and compliance, where permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Reporting and Appeals</h2>
  <p>
    Report posts, pinned boards, events, or users through in-app reporting or the Help Center. If you believe enforcement was incorrect,
    you may contact support via the Help Center. We may not be able to provide detailed reasons in all cases (e.g., safety, legal, or privacy constraints).

  <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p><b>We do not sell your personal information.</b></p>

  <h3>3.1 Service providers</h3>
  <p>
    We may share information with vendors that process data on our behalf to operate the Service (e.g., hosting, databases, analytics,
    customer support tooling, and push notification delivery). They are authorized to use information only as needed to provide services to us.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Legal, safety, and enforcement</h3>
  <p>
    We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with law, respond to lawful requests,
    protect our users, investigate abuse, enforce our terms/policies, or protect rights, safety, and property.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Public and group visibility</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on how the Service is configured, your profile information and User Content may be visible to others in groups or other areas of the Service.
    Your interactions (such as likes and comments) may be visible to others where those features are enabled.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 External links and third parties</h3>
  <p>
    If you click an External Link (including links for digital events), you leave the Service and the third party’s privacy policy applies.
    Aligno is not responsible for third-party practices.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Account settings:</b> you can edit certain profile fields in-app.</li>

    <li><b>Content deletion:</b> you can delete your own posts and certain content, subject to technical constraints and retention described below.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes, such as maintaining records, preventing abuse,
    enforcing policies, resolving disputes, and complying with legal obligations. Even if you delete content, we may retain certain records
    (including logs, reports, and enforcement history) to the extent permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect information. However, no system is 100% secure,
    and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us via the in-app Help Center.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International Use</h2>
  <p>
    If you access the Service from outside the United States, your information may be processed in the United States or other locations where we
    or our service providers operate.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy. The “Last updated” date indicates when changes became effective. Continued use after changes means you
    accept the updated policy to the maximum extent permitted by law.
